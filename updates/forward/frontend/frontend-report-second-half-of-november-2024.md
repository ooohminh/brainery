## React

### [React Router v7: New features and flexible development options](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7)

React Router v7 introduces `framework mode` with features from Remix, including server rendering and improved type safety. It also includes enhanced templates for starting new projects, and comprehensive upgrade guides for React Router v6 and Remix v2 users.

### [React Anti-Pattern: Stop Passing Setters Down the Components Tree](https://matanbobi.dev/posts/stop-passing-setter-functions-to-components)

Passing `useState` setters as props can lead to abstraction leaks, reducing clarity and reusability, making it harder to reason about the state. A better approach is to use callback functions to handle state changes, making your code more maintainable and flexible.
